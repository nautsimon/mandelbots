<Servos>
Normal Servos go clockwise in rotation from 0' to 180'.
in ftc the values range from 0.0 to 1.0.
The HS-785HB servo is unique in that it is geared down with a servo range of < 4 rotations
[LS] Lift Servo HS-785HB
CW(closer to 1) to lift up, CCW(closer to 0) to push in
This servo lifts the paddle that pushes blocks into the intake

[FS] Flap Servo HS-785HB
mounting direction unknown
This servo adjusts the plate that the blocks rest on
CW(closer to 1) to receive, CCW(closer to 0) to drop

[WS] Wrist Servo HS-785HB
n/a all

<Continous rotation servos>

[AS] Arm Servo HFR-1425CR
mounting direction unknown
This servo adjusts the plate that the blocks rest on
CW(closer to 1) to open, CCW(closer to 0) to drop


<Other Motors>
These motors are all 60:1 Neverest am3103 motors
https://www.andymark.com/NeveRest-60-Gearmotor-p/am-3103.htm
The encoder is 7 pulses per revolution, so 420 pulses per revolution of the
shaft.

[PM] Pulley Motor (60:1 Neverest motor)
mounting direction unknown
This is the motor that lifts the pulles that the block is on.

[LIM] Intake Motor (40:1 Neverest Motor)

<Arm Actuaters>

[AM] Arm Motor (60:1 Neverest Motor)
mounting direction unknown
this motor actuates the arm slide

[AS] Arm Servo HS-785HB
actuates the relic grabber
